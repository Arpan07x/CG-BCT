# Computer Graphics Lab Repository  

**Class:** BCT II/I, Himalaya College of Engineering  

Welcome to the **Computer Graphics Lab Repository**!  
This repository is designed for students of BCT II/I at Himalaya College of Engineering to submit their computer graphics lab assignments in an organized and efficient manner. Each student will have a dedicated branch, and submissions must follow the specified folder structure.

---

## Repository Structure

Each student must submit their assignments on their respective branch, using their **name** as the main folder. Within this folder, lab submissions should be organized as follows:

```
/<Your_Name>
   â”œâ”€â”€ Lab_<Lab_Number>
       â”œâ”€â”€ code.py       # Python script containing the lab code
       â”œâ”€â”€ output.png    # Screenshot(s) of the program's output
       â”œâ”€â”€ algorithm.md  # Markdown file with the algorithm/steps implemented
```

### Example:

```
/John_Doe
   â”œâ”€â”€ Lab_1
       â”œâ”€â”€ code.py
       â”œâ”€â”€ output.png
       â”œâ”€â”€ algorithm.md
   â”œâ”€â”€ Lab_2
       â”œâ”€â”€ code.py
       â”œâ”€â”€ output.png
       â”œâ”€â”€ algorithm.md
```

## Submission Guidelines

1. **Branch Assignment:**
   - Each student has a dedicated branch. Ensure you are working in your assigned branch.

2. **Folder Naming:**
   - Use your **name** (First_Last format, e.g., `John_Doe`) for the main folder name.
   - Create a separate subfolder for each lab, named as `Lab_<Lab_Number>` (e.g., `Lab_1` for the first lab).

3. **Required Files in Each Lab Folder:**
   - **Python Code (`code.py`):** Your complete lab solution in Python, with proper comments explaining key steps.
   - **Output Screenshot (`output.png`):** A screenshot of the program output demonstrating the correct implementation of the lab task.
   - **Algorithm (`algorithm.md`):** A concise and well-structured markdown file detailing the algorithm or steps implemented in your code.

4. **Completeness:**
   - Ensure that all required files are included in the appropriate format before submission.
