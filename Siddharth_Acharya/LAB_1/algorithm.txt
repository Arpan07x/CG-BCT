Import the necessary library:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Get user inputs:
Read and convert the x and y coordinates for two points to integers.

Calculate differences:
Compute the absolute differences dx and dy between the coordinates.

Determine the number of steps:
Set steps to the maximum of dx and dy.

Calculate increments:
Compute x_incr and y_incr as dx / steps and dy / steps.

Initialize starting point:
Set initial values for x and y to the first point's coordinates.

Store initial point:
Add the starting point to x_list and y_list.

Generate points:
Loop through the number of steps, updating x and y by their increments, rounding them, and adding to the lists.

Print the lists of points:
Output the lists x_list and y_list.

Print the starting point:
Display the starting point coordinates.

Plot the points:
Create a plot with the generated points and highlight the start and end points.

Show the plot:
Display the plot with labels, grid, and legend.
