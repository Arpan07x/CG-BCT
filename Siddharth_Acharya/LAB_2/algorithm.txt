Input: Starting point (x1, y1), Ending point (x2, y2)

1. Calculate Differences:
   Δx = |x2 - x1|
   Δy = |y2 - y1|

2. Determine Line Orientation:
   If Δx >= Δy:
      Line has a shallow slope
   Else:
      Line has a steep slope

3. Set Step Directions:
   sx = 1 if x2 > x1, -1 if x2 < x1
   sy = 1 if y2 > y1, -1 if y2 < y1

4. Initialize Decision Parameter:
   If shallow slope:
      err = 2Δy - Δx
   Else:
      err = 2Δx - Δy

5. Plot Initial Point:
   Plot (x, y) = (x1, y1)

6. Iterate Until Endpoint:
   If shallow slope:
      For x from x1 to x2:
         Plot (x, y)
         If err >= 0:
            y += sy
            err -= 2Δx
         err += 2Δy
   Else:
      For y from y1 to y2:
         Plot (x, y)
         If err >= 0:
            x += sx
            err -= 2Δy
         err += 2Δx

7. Terminate:
   Stop when (x, y) = (x2, y2)

Output: Sequence of plotted points forming the line
